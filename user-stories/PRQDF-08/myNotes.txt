Notes for the user-story PRQDF-08

As the DMPJ Organizer, I would like you to have your own Github repo so that you can share code with the other folks.
Be sure you have installed Git on your machine, and understand how it works. See the ticket "Understand Git".
-- Create a public repo called DMPJ. You will want it on Github, and your local machine, so that you can push your local work to Github.

-- As the first directory in the repo, create a directory named ./user-stories/{this-project}-6. So, if your project abbreviation is FOO, your directory would be ./user-stories/FOO?-6.

-- For each user story you work on, you will create a directory like this.
(For user story 17, the directory would be FOO?-17.)For this user story, commit a file named name.txt, in this directory.
It should have a single line, containing your name.
The path to that file is then ./dmpj/user-stories/{this-project}-6/name.txt.
This is how you will arrange the files for all of the user stories you work on.
The root directory is dmpj, and inside the user-stories directory, you will have a directory for each user story.
Within that folder, are any files relevant to that user story.
