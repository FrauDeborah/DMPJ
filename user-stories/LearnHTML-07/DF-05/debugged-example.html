    <p>What causes errors in HTML?</p>

    <ul>
      <!--added closing </li> to the first list item and closed strong after not  -->
      <li>Unclosed elements: If an element is <strong>not </strong>closed properly, then its effect can spread to areas you didn't intend. </li>

      <!--added closing </li> to the 2nd list item,  fixed embedded strong and emphasis in revised text-->
      <li>Badly nested elements: Nesting elements properly is also very important for code behaving correctly. <strong>This is a closed strong.</strong> <em>This is a closed emphasised</em>? What is this? <strong><em>This is an enphasised & strong phrase.</em></strong></li>

      <!--added closing </li> to the first list item & a closing quote to the href. Also removed "link to" -->
      <li>Unclosed attributes: Another common source of HTML problems. Let's look at an example which was fixed: <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/"> Mozilla's homepage </a> </li>
    </ul>
