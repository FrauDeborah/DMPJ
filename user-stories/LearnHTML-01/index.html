    <p>Hello, my name is Deborah Frauenfelder. I am an avid toastmaster who enjoys public speaking and leadership. <strong>What is a toastmaster?</strong> A <em>toastmaster</em> is a member of a club charted by Toastmasters International. <a href="https://www.toastmasters.org/"  title=”Toastmasters International” target=”_blank”>Toastmasters International</a>, a non-profit organization, teaches communication and leadership skills in a club environment. Clubs typically have 20-30 members who participate in various roles during club meetings. Members give manual speeches and receive immediate feedback from speech evaluators.  The same skills learned at club meetings can be applied during any real life speaking opportunity. For example speaking at employee meetings, or speaking at staff meeting, or speaking around the water cooler or speaking in your community.</p>
    <p>I'm excited about the new <a href="https://www.toastmasters.org/Pathways-Overview/"  title=”The Toastmasters Pathways” target=”_blank”>Toastmasters Pathways </a> education program which is being rolled out in District 26 by Toastmasters International. Pathways will transition us from using various manuals to using an online integrated education platform.</p>
    <p>In 2015-2016 I had the privilege of leading <a href= https://www.d26toastmasters.org/  title=”District 26 Toastmasters” target=”_blank”> District 26 Toastmasters </a> which includes clubs located in Colorado, Wyoming and northwest Nebraska. Now I hold the title Past District Director with the Distinguished Toastmaster (DTM) credential.</p>
    <p>Currently, I am participating with the <em>Denver Mock Program Job (DMPJ)</em> lead by Johnathan James. What a brilient idea for hosting the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Denver-Mock-Programming-Job-Meetup/"  title=”Denver Mock Programming Job Meetup” target=”_blank”> DMPJ MeetUp</a>, which allows people to experience 1st hand the Agile development process.</p>
